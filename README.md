StudyBud is a web application built using Django, a popular Python web framework. The app aims to provide a platform for students to create and share study materials, collaborate with peers, and track their progress on academic goals.

Here's an overview of some of the key features of StudyBud:

User registration and authentication: Students can create an account on StudyBud and log in securely using their email and password. Django's built-in authentication system can be used to implement this feature.

Dashboard and profile page: After logging in, students are taken to their dashboard where they can see their progress on their academic goals, view their study materials, and interact with their peers. Each user also has a profile page where they can customize their settings and view their personal information.

Study materials creation and sharing: Students can create and share study materials such as notes, flashcards, quizzes, and more. They can also organize their study materials into folders for easy navigation and categorization.

Collaboration and messaging: Students can collaborate with their peers by sharing study materials and messaging each other. This feature can be implemented using Django's messaging framework or a third-party library.

Goal tracking and progress tracking: Students can set academic goals such as completing a certain number of courses or earning a specific grade. They can track their progress towards these goals using visual charts and graphs.

Social sharing: StudyBud can also integrate with social media platforms to allow students to share their study materials and progress with their friends and followers.
